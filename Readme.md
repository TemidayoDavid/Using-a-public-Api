Hello,

This is my first project using a public API. The API that i chose to use is the Joke API and you can read more about its documentation here: https://v2.jokeapi.dev/joke

In my version of the Api, i simply used this to practice the lessons on applying 
HTML, CSS, EJS, NODE and AXIOS

As my skill progress i plan to upgrade it to take multiple queries. For now, enjoy.

Please read the following to start the app

1. Run
   **npm i**
   _to install all the node modules_

2. if you have to change type in package.json to modular
   **"type": "module"**

3. Run
   **nodemon index.js**
   to start application on local computer at port 3000

4. Run on browser
   **https://localhost:3000**
